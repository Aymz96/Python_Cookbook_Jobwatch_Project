# python_job_watch_project

- In this folder I have my Chef Cookbook I had created.
- I have provisioned various packages and used bash commands to install requirements plugins.
- I have also created a TDD to confirm my project executes with no errors.
- I have also created a packer.json which in turn creates the AMI on aws. I then use this AMI to launch my EC2 instance.
