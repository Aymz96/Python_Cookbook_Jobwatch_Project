# :key: :computer: Sparta Global Python Application Project CI/:cd:

### Introduction
 - This Project has been set by Sparta Global. The aim of this project is to run tests for an IT_Job_Scraper application by creating a working CI/CD pipeline. 

 _ The CI will be developing, testing then merging the code through a Jenkins job using a Slave Node. Then Using a CD pipeline to that uses a Jenkins job to build an AMI using Packer.

### What is Chef?
- Chef is a company and the name of a configuration management tool written in Ruby and Erlang. It uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language for writing system configuration "recipes".

- Chef is used to streamline the task of configuring and maintaining a company's servers, and can integrate with cloud-based platforms such as Internap, Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle Cloud, OpenStack, SoftLayer, Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace to automatically provision and configure new machines.

### What is vagrant?
- Vagrant is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments, e.g. for VirtualBox, KVM, Hyper-V, Docker containers, VMware, and AWS. It tries to simplify the software configuration management of virtualizations in order to increase development productivity.

### What is an AMI?
- An Amazon Machine Image is a special type of virtual appliance that is used to create a virtual machine within the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. It serves as the basic unit of deployment for services delivered using EC2.

### What is Packer?
- Packer is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Packer is lightweight, runs on every major operating system, and is highly performant, creating machine images for multiple platforms in parallel. Packer does not replace configuration management like Chef or Puppet. In fact, when building images, Packer is able to use tools like Chef or Puppet to install software onto the image.

### What is Jenkins?
- Jenkins is a free and open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. It is a server-based system

### What is a Slave Node in Jenkins?
- The Jenkins slave nodes set up for offload build projects from the master, and it's required an establish connection between the master and slaves. Jenkins slave nodes can run on a variety operating systems like Windows and Linux, and there is no need to install full Jenkins packages on it.

### What is Git?
- Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

### What is GitHub?
- GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.
